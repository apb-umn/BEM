## ðŸ“„ Abstract

This paper develops a method to analyze policy reforms in environments with discrete choice, such as occupational choice or default. Computing transition paths in these settings is computationally challenging, especially in models with substantial heterogeneity and many endogenous states. We extend perturbation methods to handle discrete choice by tracking both:
- **Intensive-margin** changes conditional on choices (typically smooth and small), and
- **Extensive-margin** changes from switching choices (discrete and potentially large).

The method is fast, scalable, and efficient â€” providing high-quality initial estimates for global solution methods. We apply this approach to evaluate optimal business taxation in a heterogeneous-agent model with occupational choice between wage work and entrepreneurship.

## ðŸ§­ Repository Overview

This codebase supports:
- Solving **steady state equilibria** using an Endogenous Grid Method (EGM).
- Simulating **transition dynamics** after tax policy shocks.
- Performing **optimal tax computations** over grids of business tax rates (`Ï„_b`).
- **Second- and zeroth-order approximations** of dynamic paths.

## ðŸ§  Notes for Researchers

- Transition logic combines both continuous perturbation and discrete switching.
- Tax simulations focus on welfare across `Vss`, `VinitSO`, and `VinitFO`.
- Code is modular for extensions: e.g., new frictions, occupations, or policy instruments.
